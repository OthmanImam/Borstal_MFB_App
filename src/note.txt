Mock API Services
For mock API services like MockAPI.io, you can define multiple endpoints by creating different resources in the same project. For instance:

Create the "customers" resource:

Paste the customers array into the JSON body for this endpoint.
Generate the API URL (e.g., https://mockapi.io/customers).
Create the "loans" resource:

Paste the loans array into the JSON body for this endpoint.
Generate the API URL (e.g., https://mockapi.io/loans).
Create the "transactions" resource:

Paste the transactions array into the JSON body for this endpoint.
Generate the API URL (e.g., https://mockapi.io/transactions).


1. Introduction
I'm a React developer, and I've developed the frontend for a Hybrid Backup System for Borstal Micro Finance Bank, currently using dummy data to simulate the system's functionality.
2. Frontend Overview
The system's frontend is designed to manage backups, monitor analytics, and interact with customers, giving the bank an interface for manual and cloud-based data management.
3. Key Features of the Frontend
Dashboard Page: This page provides an overview of backup statuses, recent activity, and internet connection alerts. It's the main hub for monitoring backup progress and viewing insights.
Files Page: Displays a list of backed-up files with details like file name, upload date, and size, simulated using dummy data.
Analytics Page: Simulates data insights, showing backup statistics and trends that would be generated from real data in the future.
Settings Page: Allows users to manage account settings, switch between themes (e.g., dark/light mode), and configure backup preferences.
Customers Page: Displays customer information such as names, contact details, and account balances, also using dummy data.
4. Technology Stack
React: Used for creating dynamic UI components.
Ant Design & Tailwind CSS: For building a clean, responsive layout and styling.
State Management: Managed via Redux or React's Context API, handling simulated interactions like file uploads and notifications.
5. Next Steps
Integrating with the backend to replace dummy data with real customer data and files.
Adding live analytics and real-time processing once the cloud services are connected.
6. Conclusion
The frontend simulates the complete workflow for managing data backups and analytics. It's ready for backend integration to deliver full functionality.
